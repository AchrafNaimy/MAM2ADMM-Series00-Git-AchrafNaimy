This notebook computes and plots **ENMO (Euclidean Norm Minus One)** integrated over epochs of **10s, 30s, and 60s** using wrist accelerometer data.

## Step 1: Import Libraries
We import `pandas` for data handling, `numpy` for numerical calculations, and `matplotlib` for visualization. 
These are essential for loading accelerometer data, computing ENMO, and plotting results.

## Step 2: Load Data
We read the CSV file containing accelerometer readings (`t`, `x`, `y`, `z`). 
Lines starting with '#' are ignored as comments. 
Only relevant columns are selected for analysis.

## Step 3: Compute ENMO
ENMO (Euclidean Norm Minus One) removes the gravitational component from acceleration.  
We calculate the vector magnitude of acceleration, subtract 1 g, and keep only positive values.  
This gives a measure of physical activity intensity.

## Step 4: Epoch Integration
We divide the data into epochs of 10, 30, and 60 seconds.  
For each epoch, we integrate ENMO values to summarize activity in that time interval.

## Step 5: Visualization
We create 6 vertical plots:
1. Bar plots of integrated ENMO for each epoch length.
2. Line plots of raw ENMO over time.
This allows comparison between raw and summarized activity.

## My Motivation  

For me, Python is the toolbox that transforms ideas into concrete prototypes.
R is the lens through which I explore data and reveal the patterns hidden within numbers. Git feels like a personal time machine — each commit a snapshot of progress and growth. Together, they make me fluent in creating, analyzing, and sharing knowledge. Mastering these tools is my way of blending creativity with precision in the digital world.  

## Summary

I learned how to create a repository on GitHub and clone it locally using GitHub Desktop.
I explored how to work on a branch and update the README.md file.
I understood the role of commits in saving local changes.
I practiced using push to send modifications back to GitHub.
This assignment gave me a clearer understanding of the workflow with branches, commits, and pushes.

⏱️ Time spent: about 1.5 hours.
